# introduction

Adding badgers next to each organic result in the search feed for you to check the website safety without the hassle

Disclaimer: I have integrated the reputation score of WOT in order to provide the status of the website URL in the feed and I am not responsible for any miscategorization

Please note that the extension only adds badgers next to organic results in your feed. it does not add the badger next to ads. You cannot check the status/safety level of the ads page
