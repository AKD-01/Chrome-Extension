FLASHCARDS FROM NOTION

- Write notes in Notion and easily turn them into flashcards
- Surround text with curly brackets to make cloze deletions ( {{Asia}} is the world's biggest continent)
- Use two colons to create rich flashcards with images and markdown in Notion (e.g. What does USA stand for? :: United States of America)

SPACED-REPETITION

- FLASHCARDS reminds you when it's time to review the cards you want to remember, so that you never forget them again
